Just kidding. That [Pin Bender](2023-07-29%20Pin%20Bender.md)? Totally not necessary. I got some 1/8" x 3/4" aluminum bar (12' lengths, cut in half) and it easily bends to the curve of the trailer.

The 3/4" width fits nicely into a groove on the back of the plastic frame, so I clamped it in place and drilled small holes for bolts to come from the back (wall) side and then drilled larger holes for the screws that mount the aluminum to the wall.

Making the rails was not very hard, but mounting them was a pain (as expected). It's a little nerve-wracking to drill pilot holes into the wall of a trailer.

The hard part, though, was holding the plastic frames in place, with the tiny bolts aligned through the holes drilled in the frames and then getting a very small nut threaded on the small protrusion. It got a little better after finding the right open-ended wrench (5/16" for a # 6 nut).

> Lesson Learned: Pliers, adjustable crescent wrenches, and sockets (even with a tiny ratchet handle) are all the wrong tools for a confined space.

We got both sides attached, and put on the top and bottom... only to find that the sides were too far apart. We repositioned on rail, redid the bolts, and got the top and bottom in place.

> Lesson Learned: measure twice... in all of the dimensions.

We'd used 3/4" bolts on one side and 1/2" bolts on the second. The 3/4" are _much_ easier to get the nuts on, but interfere with the sliding screen support. So I used a dremel with a cutoff wheel to remove the extra length. Happily, I was wearing a face shield, because this threw grit right at me.

The dremel cut right through the tiny bolts, but this caused bits of hot metal to fall on the bed... which is a non-natural fiber and instantly melted little pock marks.

> Lesson Learned: cut _almost_ through a bolt, let it cool, and the break of the last bit with pliers.

The rails look like they're doing a good job of holding the frame right up against the wall. There's a bit of fiddling needed to move the slider past the bolts, but it's not bad.

However, the top is still warped. This lets light in, and will probably let bugs in too, if the screen is down at night and the cabin lights are on.

I think that aluminum will work fine to stiffen the top as well, and I'm not even sure I'll need to screw the bar into the wall, which would make installation much, much simpler. I think the screen assembly slides into a groove like the fuzzy piece in the sides. But that's a project for another weekend.

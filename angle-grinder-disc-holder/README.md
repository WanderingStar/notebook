I would like a holder to keep my angle grinder discs in.
* For 4.5" discs, with a 5/8 arbor
* Post for holding the discs
* Lid
* Needs to fit well in my Packout toolbox (4.5" height)

I found a bunch of models online that are *almost* what I want, but not quite. So I guess I'll need to model this...

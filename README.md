This is intended to be something like a lab notebook for various projects. However, my degree is in Math, so I've never had to keep a lab notebook. There should probably be more contemporaneous data gathering going on here, but for now there's just retrospective description.

These are all hobby projects, and I likely have no idea what I'm doing, so keep that in mind before you try to replicate anything. Suggestions welcome!

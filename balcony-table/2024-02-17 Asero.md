Surprise! Asero has 1" x 3" rectangular tube. They just don't have it in their online stock list for some reason. I bought a 24' stick, cut into 48" sections. That gives me a full 48" piece for mistakes.

Sadly, the Free "Personal" version of Fusion 360 doesn't let me save a construction drawing. I can export images, though. So I've printed off one with the sketch that shows all of the dimensions.

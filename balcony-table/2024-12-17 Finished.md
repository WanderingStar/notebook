After a test fitting and a bit of Bondo to fill in the gaps in the inside corners, it was time for finishing.

I spent a lot of the last few weeks spray painting. I was just not getting good finishes. Drips. Unevenness. Perfectionism run amok. 

I finally sanded everything down, hit it with a coat of primer, and a coat of satin and called it good enough in time for our housewarming.

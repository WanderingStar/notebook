Adrienne found this design. It looks buildable. The angled legs give more visual interest than rectilinear ones.

The inspiration image looks like it's a size I can't get in rectangular tube at Asero. Looks wider than 1 x 2, which is what they have.


I wrestled my way through modeling this in Fusion 360. Getting a distinctly non-right angle was a little tricky. I think the inspiration table may be pretty short for its width, because any angle more than 100 degrees at the base starts getting narrower than looks safe.

This is the strike plate that was installed.

I found this diagram by searching online.

Apart from the shape of the latch hole, this is a good match for the existing strike plate. Our strike plates have a 90° bent piece at the front of the latch hole, for alignment. I measured the extra length I thought we'd need and extended the part in that direction. I guessed that the angle of the main bend should be ~15°.

I sketched this in Fusion.

And then used the Sheet Metal mode for the bends

I 3D printed one, to make sure it fits... Pretty good. A little long.

Josh suggested just having [SendCutSend](https://app.sendcutsend.com) make these for me. For 10, it's a pretty reasonable $137.

Joe suggested [using 3D printed dies and the hydraulic press](https://yo.asmbly.org/t/making-door-strike-plates/12028/6) which sounds like an interesting learning experience...

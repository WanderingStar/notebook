I was going to write more here, but long story short, I re-did the endcaps on the Tormach. I milled in guidelines for the edges of the actual area, since the bandsaw doesn't cut square in any dimension.

This left the challenge of removing the material on those edges. I tried:
1. Belt grinder. The platen and the work support aren't actually square, and this took forever
2. Cold saw. Too hard to align the cut on a piece this small
3. Angle grinder. The winner. Cutoff disc for a rough (but pretty close!) cut. Sanding disc to finish

Welding these on to the ends of the tubes was not hard, and the sanding disc and a machinist's square made getting square ends and equal lengths not too bad.

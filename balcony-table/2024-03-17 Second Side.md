Welded up the second side.

Tried using the techniques described by [Fireball Tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjlTodHNjPU) but of course I don't have enough fixtures to do that.

Used the cold cut saw to cut some angles. While the miter allows you to set a 50Â° angle, if you actually cut that, you'll cut through the base of the vise. I got a tip to use a sacrificial piece of wood under the piece being cut, so there's time

Using blue tape to hold the inserts that will go in the horizontal struts seems to have worked reasonably well. Drilling all the way through the 3" tube does not result in the holes being very well centered or consistent, but with the insert taped to the bottom, at least they're in the right place.

[Using the die grinder pulling technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pnL4P0vr_8), I was able to get the inside corner joints roughly the right shape. I need to try the leather blending tips. I was not able to get the trivially perfect rounded corner I'd hoped for with the [metal router bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFu5s7p9zMA) in the die grinder, but having just re-watched that I might not have had the speed up as high as I should have.

I wasn't being very careful when I selected my tubing, and the bottom tube is bowed out. I think it was that way even before I welded it. As a result, the second side is almost a quarter inch taller than the first side. I think I can put feet on the bottom or shim it to solve that problem, but it's frustrating.

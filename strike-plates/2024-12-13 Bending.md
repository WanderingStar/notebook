I got some material from Westbrook's drops. It felt light, so I asked at the counter if it was stainless, and they said yes, so I assumed that it was just thin enough... No. When Joe laser cut it, it became clear that it was aluminum.

Another trip got something that was *definitely* stainless, and Joe produced a nice set of blanks.

I did a test bend at Asmbly with clamps and it worked well. But I realized that because of spring back, I needed to make the bend angle more than the target angle. I'd estimated the target angle at 15°, so I gave 20° a try. Works pretty well, but my alignment pins aren't long enough to hold everything.

With longer pins (cut on my home bandsaw), I was able to bend the rest of the blanks easily on my bench vise. The spacing of the pins conveniently missed the vise jaws. I used a countersink bit in a hand drill to make screws sit a bit more flush, but the material wasn't thick enough for me to be confident there'd be enough to bite into if I countersunk fully flush.

After bending a dozen of these, you can see some marking on the dies where the edge of the strike plate was, but no serious damage.

All in all, a successful project.

If I were going to do it again, I'd size the holes for the alignment pins to the pins, not to the holes in the part, and I'd add at least one more alignment pin. It would also be helpful if the pins didn't go all the way through the jig. Eric suggested a press fit, which is one possibility. Having them bottom out on one side of the jig might also work.

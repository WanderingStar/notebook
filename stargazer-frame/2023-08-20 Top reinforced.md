![Disassembling the top](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53130678501_08a854da95_c.jpg)

I disassembled the top, slid out the shade, and clamped a piece of aluminum to the top frame. I left it clamped overnight in the hope that it would straighten some. It didn't really. Drilled the holes. Put it back. It's definitely stiffer, but not as solid as I'd hoped.

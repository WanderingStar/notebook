I'm running a minicomputer in my trailer (Beelink Min S12 Pro). I'd hoped to run it off of the 12V battery, and chose a model that took 12V in for that reason. However, it draws too much current and blows a fuse when I try to use it. I should be able to wire another circuit into the trailer power system, but haven't gotten up the gumption.

The trailer is plugged in to shore power almost all of the time, so for now I'm using a [power pack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H8F5HYJ) plugged in to 120V that can keep the computer running while we drive to a campsite.

After talking with Ethan a bit about strategy, I decided to use the Tormach, instead of a drill press to make the holes through the legs. If I can precisely locate the part on the table, I will be able to make shallow holes on both sides, rather than 3" holes all the way through.

Using one mod vise to hold the piece in place, and the fixed jaw of another as a stop worked pretty well.

It would have been nice if I could have flipped the part across the X axis, so the same *end* of the piece was in the same place, but the spindle travel is just not big enough. Flipping across the Y axis worked well enough.

Next, I needed to put identically spaced holes into the end caps for the connecting struts. These are going to be tapped, so instead of my 1/4" drill bit, I used Asmbly's #7 (.2010"). It immediately broke. I'd hoped that I'd decreased the feed rate enough to account for the difference in bit quality (standard HSS vs coated), but clearly not.

Okay, plan B: I can mill out these holes with an 1/8" end mill. One trick about this: by milling instead of drilling, I'd be putting side loads on the piece, not just drilling straight down. The vise turned out to not be up to the task by itself, so I added a strap clamp.

Ok, ready to mill... the 1/8" end mill immediately broke. I had made some coordinate system error, I think (which might also have been related to why the drill bit broke). I put in my spare 1/8" end mill, resolved to order more, and actually drilled the holes. I tested the first one for fit, and the bolt 
passed through both the leg and the end cover cleanly, so I re-ran the program for the rest of the covers.

Next up, tapping... wait, did I say that the bolt *passed through* the cover? Oops. That means I made 1/4" holes, not .2010, so when I tried to tap them, nothing happened.

Clearly time to call it a day. I cut some plate stock to try this again later, and packed up.

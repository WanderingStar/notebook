I, of course, want to put a logo on top. I don't really want to tie up the Prusa XL for as long as it would take to print this mostly single-color print. What If I print the logo in one color, then print the model on top in a different color without clearing the plate of anything but the skirt? One trick might be making sure we miss the Z probe for the second print...

Probably also smart to print just the thread, to make sure it works, since this is my first time making a thread:

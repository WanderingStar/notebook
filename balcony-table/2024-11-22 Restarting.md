This project took a bit of a hiatus. I finished the second side and I was not happy with how asymmetrical the two came out. There's a lot of bowing that prevents them from sitting next to each other, and the holes for the cross pieces are not very straight.

I also started taking a fabrication class at Austin Community College, and think I've learned enough to do a better job this time.

Back in August, I used the CNC router to cut a jig out of MDF:

Now, I've gathered the materials needed to try again...

I started out by cutting the rectangular tube on the [cold saw](https://wiki.asmbly.org/index.php/Precision_Matthews_CS-350_Cold_Saw). It does a pretty good job of making the precise angles needed (repeatable within a few tenths of a degree)

I attached the MDF jig to the fixture table... and realized I'd gotten the spacing wrong for the holes. I'm not sure how I did that, but enough of them work that the jig can still be held in place.

I placed the pieces into the jig as I cut them to check the fit. I used the belt grinder to tune them up as necessary. This was a bad idea, because the belt grinder is nothing like square. I later realized that the angle grinder is a better tool for all of the fine tuning. A cutting disc is more accurate than trying to remove a small piece with any of the saws here, and a sanding disc is better for sanding down to a line.

I clamped the pieces down to the table, which would have worked better if I'd aligned the holes in the jig properly. And then tacked the corners. In retrospect, the holes I left at the corners of the jig should have been much bigger to give access to the joint for welding.

The angles and lengths weren't perfect, of course, so I had to fill some gaps by stacking tacks. That went fine. I didn't get as good a fit as I'd hoped for the bottom inside corners, so I'm going to need to fill them later.

I've now taken the Metal Shop Safety class at [Asmbly](https://asmbly.org), and done a MIG checkout, so I booked some time.

First order of business: use the drill press to drill the bolt holes. This turned out to be unexpectedly challenging, because the vise + 3" of rectangular tube makes it hard to get the bit enough clearance. Eventually I finagled it, but it meant rechucking the bit between drilling the top side of the piece and the bottom.

I should probably have drilled the caps for the horizontal tubes at the same time, but I couldn't figure out how to keep them in place. (Hindsight: tape.)

Next, using the fixture table. I got a bunch of useful-seeming fixtures from Fireball Tool. Fences, round pins, clamps, locking pliers. They all turned out to be useful.

Downside to this fixture table: the surface is thin enough (3/8") that the pegs rock back and forth a bit in the holes. This meant that clamping down the fences was required to get them to be fully stable. Once the part was in place, I could clamp down the part instead.

After some more grinding on the belt sander, I got the top angles to 80.0°, and the bottom to 100.05° and 100.25°, which seems pretty respectable.

I tacked all four corners, then went ahead and welded them on both side faces. Then I did the inside corners.

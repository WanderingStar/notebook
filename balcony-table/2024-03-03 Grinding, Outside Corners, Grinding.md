I ground off the sharp outside corners and welded three of them... and ran out of wire.

I'm trying various approaches to cleaning up the inside corners. The die grinder with a ball or rounded cylinder die seems to be pretty good for roughing it in. I'm learning to pull the grinder, rather than push it, because otherwise it kicks. A few passes cuts down the convex bead.

Blending with flap discs seems like the best way to blend the roughed corners that I've found. I need to be careful to not take off too much material.

I'm going to have to figure out how to blend corners to match the filet on the rectangular tube. They're much too sharp now.

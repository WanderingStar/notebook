Added a feedback sensor variable:
```
text_sensor:
  - platform: template
    name: "Somnolence"
    id: somnolence
    icon: "mdi:sleep"
    retain: true
```

Which I'm setting manually in the sleep loop:
```
- text_sensor.template.publish:
	id: somnolence
	state: "Awake"
```

Also changed the code to only be on continuously if the `prevent_deep_sleep` sensor is on or it hasn't yet made contact with the MQTT broker (eg. because the Wifi hasn't connected yet). Otherwise it has a ~1 minute cycle while the battery is at 3.7V or higher, and a ~5 minute cycle below that.

I'm probably finished with this project for a while, barring problems.

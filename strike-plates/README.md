In our newly-remodeled house, almost all of the tongues of the doorknobs hit the trim, instead of the strikeplates, marring the trim. Our contractor says that nobody has ever complained about this style of trim doing this before. It seems difficult to find strike plates of the appropriate dimensions.

What if we made them?

Cut the parts for the sides on my horizontal band saw. General process:

1. Make the angle I want (40° or 50°) on my angle finder
2. Try to set the miter angle as close as possible on the saw (the marked angles are off by degrees)
3. Use the angle finder to scribe a more precise mark for the angle
4. Use my vertical belt sander to grind down to that angle
5. Take that piece back to the saw and use it to fine-tune the miter angle
6. Repeat the cut

Unfortunately, I didn't realized as I was doing this that the blade on the saw is not dropping perfectly vertically. So even if I have precise angles on one face, there's some slop on the other. I _think_ this is not going to matter much, because welding will fill the gaps, but it's still annoying.

Here's what it looks like dry fit.
